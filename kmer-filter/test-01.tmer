# By default (with k=5) this should give one repeat starting at
# position 2 (tmer reports zero-based positions) and ending at
# position 8:

#  b0    012345678
#  b1    123456789
#  k1     |--->
#  k2       |--->
#  range  |-----|

# If we set cov to 11, it will ignore k1, and should report one repeat
# for k2 starting at position 4, ending at position 8.


# Here is some more of the same, just to bring home the point:

1       +1000       5
1       +1001      10


# Stretch the default gap (k*3 = 15)...

## These two are merged (but separate at gap = 14 and below)
1       +3000       5
1       +3020      10

## These two are separate (but merged at gap = 16 and above)
1       +4000       2
1       +4021       2

## These two can never separate, even at gap = 0
1       +5000       5
1       +5005      10

## All three merge at gap = 1000 (unless --cov = 5)
## All four  merge at gap = 2000
